        "2.  **Accessing the Attribute:**\n",
        "    * You can access the `wagging_tail` attribute using `object_name.wagging_tail` (e.g., `my_dog.wagging_tail`).\n",
        "    * If you change the attribute using the object name (e.g. `your_dog.wagging_tail = False`), you are creating an instance attribute that shadows the class attribute for that specific instance. The class attribute remains unchanged.\n",
        "3. **Using in Methods**\n",
        "    * Methods can access the class attribute using self.wagging_tail.\n",
        "4. **Changing the attribute**\n",
        "    * You can change the attribute for a specific instance of the class, or you can change the class attribute itself, which will affect all instances of the class that do not have their own instance attributes that shadow it.\n",

        "**Key Points:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Class attributes are useful for defining default values or shared properties that are common to all instances of a class.\n",

        "4.  **Method Overriding:**\n",
        "    * The `WorkingDog` class also overrides the `eat()` method. When the eat method is called on a WorkingDog instance, the WorkingDog version of the method is executed.\n",

        "* **Data Serialization and Deserialization:**\n",
        "    * Pydantic can easily convert data between Python objects and other formats like JSON.\n",
        "* **Settings Management:**\n",

        "When you create a Pydantic model by inheriting from `BaseModel`, you're essentially:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Extending `BaseModel`:** You're adding your own fields (attributes) with their corresponding type annotations.\n",
        "2.  **Leveraging Pydantic's Features:** You're automatically getting the data validation, serialization, and deserialization capabilities provided by `BaseModel`.\n",

        "* `User` is a base model that defines common user properties.\n",
        "* `PremiumUser` inherits from `User`, and therefore automatically contains the id, name, and email fields. It also adds the subscription\\_type field.\n",
